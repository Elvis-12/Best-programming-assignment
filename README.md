Q1) Logging is the process of recording events, messages, or other information from an application. Logs are used to track the behavior and state of an application, which can be crucial for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining the software.


Q2)
1.Debugging and Error Tracking: Logs help identify where and why errors occur, making it easier to debug the application.

2.Monitoring and Maintenance: Logs provide insights into the applicationâ€™s performance and behavior over time, which can be used for regular maintenance and to identify issues before they become critical.

3.Security: Logs can record security-related events, helping in detecting and responding to security breaches.

4.Compliance and Auditing: Many industries require logging for compliance with legal or regulatory requirements. Logs provide a record of application activity that can be audited.

5.Performance Analysis: Logs can help identify performance bottlenecks by providing a detailed timeline of events within the application.

Q3)
1.Fatal: This log level indicates that at least one system component is inoperable which is causing a fatal error within the larger system.

2.Error: This log entry notes that at least one system component is inoperable and is interfering with the operability of other functionalities.

3.Warn: This log message indicates that an unexpected event has occurred in an application that may disrupt or delay other processes.

4.Info: This log level captures an event that has occurred, though it does not appear to affect operations. These alerts usually can be ignored, assuming the rest of the system continues to operate normally.

5.Debug: The debug log captures relevant detail of events that may be useful during software debugging or troubleshooting within the test environment.

6.Trace: This log level captures the execution of code. It is considered an info message and does not require action. That said, it may prove useful when the team needs full visibility within the application or a third-party library.
